### Self-Assessment : Enhancing your Dice Rolling Application

Now that you have learned how to use Modules, Namespaces, and External Libraries in TypeScript, take this knowledge and apply it to your Dice Rolling Application that you built in the Self Assessment section of Module 2.

- Refactor your dieRoller class to be a module.
- Create a namespace to hold the styling properties of your dice.
- Use Lodash to replace your iterator functions, or anywhere else you find it useful.
- Leverage the Chance.js library to enhance the randomness of your die rolls.
