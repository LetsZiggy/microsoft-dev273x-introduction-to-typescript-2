### Self-Assessment : Dice Rolling Application

Now that you have learned the basics of how to use TypeScript, you are going to make a simple dice rolling application to the following parameters:

- Use the following types in your application: Array, number, string, Boolean.
- Use an enum to declare the possible rolled values (Hint: They don't have to be numbers).
- Use a class to create your die, including typed properties for the CSS styles needed (length, width, border, color), and for the value contained within the die.
- Create an interface to describe your die's types.
- Extend the class with a dieRoller class to create a method for rolling the die.
- Create a function to instantiate dice using the dieRoller class, binding elements using the constructor() function.
- Create a button to roll all the dice at once.

The finished product should end up looking something like this, and should randomly generate a different value from the enum for each individual die when the "Roll Dice" button is pressed.
